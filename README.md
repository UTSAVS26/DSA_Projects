# DSA Projects

Welcome to the **DSA Projects** repository! This collection showcases various projects that demonstrate the use of different data structures and algorithms (DSA) to solve real-world problems. Dive in, explore, and have fun while learning!

## Projects

### 1. [Snakes Game (Arrays)](./Snake%20Game) ðŸ”—
Create the classic Snakes Game! This project will help you learn about arrays, loops, and conditional statements. You can even add features like score tracking and power-ups to make it more fun.

**Concepts Covered:**
- Arrays
- Loops
- Conditional Statements
- Game Development Basics

---

### 2. [Cash Flow Minimizer (Graphs/Multisets/Heaps)](https://github.com/UTSAVS26/DSA_Projects/tree/main/CashFlowMinimizer) ðŸ”—
Optimize cash flow among a group of people with this project. Use graphs, multisets, and heaps to minimize the total number of transactions needed to settle all debts.

**Concepts Covered:**
- Graph Theory
- Multisets
- Heaps
- Optimization Techniques

---

### 3. Sudoku Solver (Backtracking) ðŸš§
Solve Sudoku puzzles with this project. You'll use the backtracking algorithm, which is great for solving problems with constraints.

**Concepts Covered:**
- Backtracking Algorithm
- Constraint Satisfaction Problems
- Recursion

---

### 4. File Zipper (Greedy Huffman Encoder) ðŸš§
Compress files with this File Zipper project. Implement the Huffman encoding algorithm and learn about the balance between compression ratio and execution time.

**Concepts Covered:**
- Greedy Algorithms
- Huffman Encoding
- File Compression Techniques

---

### 5. Map Navigator (Dijkstra's Algorithm) ðŸš§
Build a navigation system with the Map Navigator project. Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two locations on a map, considering distance and traffic.

**Concepts Covered:**
- Graph Theory
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Shortest Path Finding
- Map Navigation Systems
